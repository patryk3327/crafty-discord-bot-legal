  <h1>Your Bot Name – Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: DATE</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains what information Your Bot Name
    (“the bot”) processes when you use it in your Discord server and how
    that information is used.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information the Bot Processes</h2>
  <p>
    To function, the bot may temporarily process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discord server ID and channel ID (to know where to respond)</li>
    <li>User ID of the person using commands (to handle permissions and replies)</li>
    <li>Command content (e.g., which server to query or manage)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used only to execute the requested command and
    provide responses such as server status or management results.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The bot does not intentionally store personal data from Discord users
    long-term, except for minimal configuration data if required
    (for example, which channel to post status updates in).
    Any such configuration data is limited to what is necessary for the bot
    to operate.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Crafty Controller Data</h2>
  <p>
    The bot connects to your Crafty Controller instance to read server
    status and send management commands. Any data about your servers
    (such as server name, online/offline status, or player count) is obtained
    from Crafty Controller and is used only to display or act on that
    information in Discord.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    The bot does not share your data with third parties. However, it runs
    on infrastructure provided by hosting providers (for example, a VPS or
    hosting platform), which may process technical data such as IP addresses
    and logs as part of normal server operation.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable measures are taken to protect configuration data and
    access credentials (such as the Crafty Controller API or URL) from
    unauthorized access. You are responsible for keeping any tokens,
    API keys, or URLs you configure for the bot secure.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    If you want any stored configuration data related to your server
    to be removed, you can remove the bot from your server and contact
    the developer to request deletion of any remaining data.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use
    of the bot after changes are published means you accept the updated
    policy.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact:
    Your Discord Tag or Contact.
