  <h1>Your Bot Name – Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>Last updated: DATE</p>

  <h2>1. Description</h2>
  <p>
    Your Bot Name is a Discord bot that integrates with Crafty Controller to
    display server status and provide basic management actions for Minecraft
    servers configured in Crafty Controller.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of the Bot</h2>
  <p>
    By using this bot, you agree to follow Discord’s Terms of Service and
    Community Guidelines. You may not use the bot for any illegal, abusive,
    or disruptive activities.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Crafty Controller Integration</h2>
  <p>
    The bot connects to your existing Crafty Controller instance to read
    server status and, where configured, send management commands
    (such as start, stop, or restart). The bot does not create or manage
    your servers itself; it only interacts with Crafty Controller as configured
    by you.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data and Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The bot may access basic Discord information required for its operation,
    such as server ID, channel ID, and user ID for commands. It does not
    intentionally collect or store message content beyond what is necessary
    to process commands, unless explicitly stated in the Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Availability and Changes</h2>
  <p>
    The bot is provided “as is” with no guarantee of uptime or continued
    availability. Features may change, be added, or removed at any time
    without prior notice.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Liability</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for how you configure and use the bot, including
    any actions it performs on your Crafty Controller instance and servers.
    The developer of this bot is not liable for any data loss, downtime,
    or damage resulting from its use.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Termination of Access</h2>
  <p>
    The developer may restrict or revoke access to the bot for any user,
    server, or integration that violates these Terms or is otherwise
    considered abusive or harmful.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about these Terms, you can contact:
    Your Discord Tag or Contact.
